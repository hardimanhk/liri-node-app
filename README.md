* This app allows users to do three things: 
    1. Search for concerts by artist
    2. Search for songs via spotify
    3. Search for movie information

* To search for a concert, pass two arguments in at the command line: concert-this and an artist of your choosing

* To search for a song, pass two arguments in at the command line: spotify-this-song and your chosen song

* To search for movie information, pass two arguments in at the command line: movie-this and your chosen movie


* The app is also capable of reading a text file and executing commands written in the file
* To use this feature create a text file called "random.txt" and pass in the argument do-what-it-says at the command line
* The structure within the text file should look like this:
    * spotify-this-song,"Don't Look Back In Anger"
